  Practice key Python skills related to:
    - imports
    - logging
    - variables
    - type hints
    - global constants
    - f-strings
    - functions
    - main function
    - conditional execution guard

OBS:
  This is your file to practice and customize.

# === DECLARE IMPORTS (BRING IN FREE CODE) ===

# === CONFIGURE LOGGER ONCE PER MODULE (PYTHON FILE) ===

# === DECLARE GLOBAL CONSTANTS ===

# All these global variables are CONSTANT, they do NOT change when the program runs.
# By convention, constants are named in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
# The following illustrates variables that hold these common types:
#    str, int, float, bool, list of strings.
# `Final` is added to indicate these variables should not be reassigned.
# Examples:

MY_ANALYTICS_COMPANY: Final[str] = "DataFun Analytics"
MY_EMPLOYEE_COUNT: Final[int] = 150

# See the other file for examples.

Welcome_Message = "Hello, Spring Data Analytics Class!" # str

year = 2026 # int

temperature = 15.3 # float, degrees Farenheit in Illinois

has_snow_on_the_ground = True  # bool, indicates if snow is on the ground

things_i_did_over_break = ["family", "rest", "eat", "ski"]  # list[str]
